# Playwright E2E Testing with Java & Spring

This project demonstrates how to use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for end-to-end (E2E) testing in a Java application built with Spring.

## Overview

## Key Features

## Example Usage
See `src/main/java/com/kerki/playwrite/example/Example.java` for a sample Spring service using Playwright.

## Getting Started
1. Add Playwright to your Maven dependencies.
2. Ensure you have the required browsers installed (see Playwright docs).
3. Run your Spring application to execute the E2E test logic.

## When to Use Playwright Over Selenium
Playwright is recommended over Selenium when you need:
- **Cross-browser support** including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari).
- **Faster and more reliable automation** with modern browser APIs and auto-waiting for elements.
- **Native support for single-page applications** and dynamic content.
- **Headless and headed execution** with easy configuration.
- **Advanced features** like browser context isolation, network interception, and emulation.

Selenium remains a good choice for legacy projects or when you need support for browsers not covered by Playwright.
